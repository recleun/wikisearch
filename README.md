# Wikisearch

Wikisearch is a tool that you can use to quickly search anything on Wikipedia, it is not published to `npm` so you will have to install it manually.

## Installation

##### You must have node.js installed, since this is coded in JavaScript.

To install it, download the code as .zip and then extract it in any folder you wish, then, open the terminal in that folder and run `npm install .` (That will install the package).
\
\
After that, you should be able to run `wikisearch -h` to view the available commands and be able to run them.
